### Geography

I live in the city of Porto Alegre, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Sidharta* by Hermann Hesse
- *Harry Potter* by J. K. Rowling
- *Gibi da Monica* by Paulo Coelho

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Tanuki in Sao Paulo.
2. Tudo pelo Social in Porto Alegre.
3. Primo Camilo in Garibaldi.
